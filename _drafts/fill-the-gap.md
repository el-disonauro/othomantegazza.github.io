title: "Fill the Gap"

Can **Open Source Hardware** help fill the gap and bring technology within
reach for everybody?

## Lessons from Software

A couple of decades ago now, the **Open Source** movement made a strong
statement on how the source code of commonly used software should be
available to everybody.

This was a matter of **fairness**. We deal with software constantly in our
life and it sounds reasonable that we know how that software works.

But this proved also **practical**. It fueled software development in the
last decades and the broad start-up environment that thrived around it.

It is worth mentioning that sharing the source code is good enough, but many
open source projects went further than that.
They made a strong statement about providing **extensive and sometimes
redundant documentation** on how to use their product, on how to take
control of it and on how to modify any aspect of it.
Thanks to **permissive** and **copyleft** licenses, then, the modified /
improved products could be distributed to the community.  

The success of this model makes a strong statement on the **benefits that
arise from a widespread and diffuse access to knowledge** for everybody in a
democratic society.

## Switch to hardware

Can this be **applied to hardware development**? shortly: yes, it is
already being done.

**Companies** and **Universities** have already recognized the potential of
**Open Hardware** or **Open Source Hardware** and are investing in it.
Certifications are also available.

## A role for Universities

Through **synthetic biology**, open hardware is already making its way to
biology and biotechnology.

I am interested in its role and impact on academic research,
specifically in the fields of biology and plant science.

### Redistributing knowledge

While it can be discussed that Open Source Hardware can have an effect on how
research is done, implementing it can have an effect on how knowledge and
technology are made available.

By definition **Open Source** software and hardware are about how knowledge
gets redistributed.

Implementing a model that makes a strong statement on **openly
redistributing knowledge as widely as possible** and on **facilitating
re-use of that knowledge / technology** seems only reasonable for
**Universities**, which indeed have a **role in society** of generating knowledge and making it available.

### Improving research experience for academics

In my (small) experience as academic researcher, one of the main issues that
we, young biologists, face is that we are mostly **end users** of very
expensive and sophisticated machines and technologies.

While the positive aspect of this is that we can perform very
complex tasks and experiments with **relatively little** effort.
The downside, in my opinion, is that in this way we partially lose control
on what we are doing.

Possible consequences of this are that:

- laboratories depend more and more on **high level funding**,
  low funded labs get left behind, which could be an issue on the global scale,
- this relegates researchers to a **performer / technical** position, in
  which they are required to perform a high number of repetitive tasks with
  little chances to modify the workflows of their experiments.

  This could be substituted by a model in which researchers, by gaining
  more control on the technology they are using, can spend time optimizing
  their experimental workflows, for example, making them simpler, less
  polluting and more accessible.
- this might have an effect also on **reproducibility** and distributed
  collaborative development, simply because the chances of making
  reproducible something on which you have no control are small.

Since only few labs implement open hardware methodically, this is mainly
a speculation. But based on the impact of open source software, open hardware
might have a role in solving this issues.

Of course the issue of a [funding system that might encourage bad scientific behavior](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/16/when-it-comes-to-science-its-the-economy-stupid/)
remains, but this could be anyway a move in the
right direction and could improve the life of young biologists.

### Impact on farming

Can Open Source Hardware, if methodically implemented, improve farming by
**lowering the costs** of tools and technology, such as plant breeding,
machinery, pest control? Can it also shift the role of a farmer from end user
to **user/developer**?

And, especially, can the **Academic Research improve its impact**, down the
line, on farming by adopting an **open knowledge / open source software and
hardware model**?

[Some organizations](http://greenwave.org/) are already investing on this
model. I am moving a little bit outside of my field of expertise right here,
so I might not be the best person to answer this questions; but as always,
the success of Open Source Software rises hopes that yes, this can happen.
