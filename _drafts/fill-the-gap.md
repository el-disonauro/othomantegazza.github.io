title: "Fill the Gap"

Can **Open Hardware** help fill the gap and bring technology within reach for
everybody?

## Lessons from Software

A couple of decades ago now, the **Open Source** movement made a strong
statement on how the source code of commonly used software should be available
to anybody.

This was a matter of **fairness**. We deal with software constantly in our
life and it sounds reasonable that we know how that software works.

But this proved also **practical** and fueled software development in the last
decade and the broad start-up environment that thrived around it.

It is worth mentioning that sharing the source code is good enough, but many
open source projects went further than that.
They made a strong statement about providing **extensive and sometimes redundant
documentation** on how to use the product, on how to take control of it and on
how to modify any aspect of it.
The success of this model makes a strong statement on the **benefits that arise
from a widespread and diffuse access to knowledge** for everybody in a
democratic society.

## Switch to hardware

Can this be **applied to hardware development**? shortly: yes, it is
already being done.

Around the world people have already recognized the potential of
**Open Hardware** or **Open Source Hardware**. With **Companies** and
**Universities** investing in it and regulatory bodies already there.

## A role for Universities

Through **synthetic biology**, open hardware is already making its way to
biology and biotechnology.

I am interested in its role and impact on plant science.

### Redistributing knowledge

The role of Universities in society is to **generate new knowledge** and **make
it available** to society.

While it can be discussed that Open Source Hardware can have an effect on how
new knowledge is generated, implementing it can have an effect on how knowledge
is made available to society.

By definition **Open Source** software and hardware are about how knowledge gets
redistributed. And implementing a model that makes a strong statement on openly
redistributing knowledge as widely as possible seems fit for Universities.
