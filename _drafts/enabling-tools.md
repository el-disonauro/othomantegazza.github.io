title: "Enabling Tools"

Among common challenges for a modern academic researcher we can probably mention:

- make research in an **interdisciplinary and distributed** context,
- maximize the chances that anybody can **reproduce** results,
- **engage** with the wide public.

The combination of three enabling tools help coping with this challenges:

- **High level programming languages**, one such as R or Python. These enable you to easily get a computer or a robot to do what you want. And also to share your rigorous set of instruction (scripts) with everybody,
- **A markup language**, such as Latex, or a combination of HTML and markdown, this enables you to easily publish what you want. It can be a blog, a text book, or an extensive manual on how to interpret your lab results,
- **A version control** tool; Git/Github. This enables open and collaborative development of your projects,

The nice things about this tools is that they have been developed in an open
source / open knowledge framework, therefore the only thing needed to
learn them (besides a computer and access to the web and - OK - understanding of basic English) is time.

These technologies have already strongly impacted academic research once, with
the advent of "big data", and I personally bet that they are going to make an impact again at the present with the implementation of open hardware and open robotics.

Here you can find the link to a few amazing resources to get
started with these tools:
