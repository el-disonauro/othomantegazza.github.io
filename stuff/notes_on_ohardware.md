These are the websites that I am keeping track of in order to get an overview
of the current state of open hardware in biology.

### OpenTrons

<https://opentrons.com/> - open source / hardware robot; plans, software and
script for protocols are tracked on github <https://github.com/OpenTrons>

### Bio Academany

<http://bio.academany.org/> - Distributed course run by George Church;
expensive, at (5000$ year?), run through Fablabs? The classes are hosted on Vimeo
and contain info on open hardware for biology.

### Gaudi lab

Open lab, an advanced list of resource is available on their website.
<http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/> plus many current projects <http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=19>
<http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/>

### Manu Prakash lab

Manu Prakash lab, home of impressive frugal science:
<https://profiles.stanford.edu/manu-prakash>
<http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab/cgi-bin/labsite/>
Tools they develop:

- [folding microscope](https://www.foldscope.com/)
- [punchcard microfuidic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4874)
- [citizen mosquito surveillance](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/25/120519)
- [paperfuge](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/30/072207)

Looks like the last two elements haven't gone through peer review yet?

### Hackteria

### Generics

- [Open Hardware Science](http://openhardware.science/)
- [Open Source hardware association](https://www.oshwa.org/)

## Bonus ;)
<https://youtu.be/SGJ5cZnoodY> - Wired UK documentary on open
hardware development in the city of Shenzhen.
