title: "A Collection of Resources for Open Hardware in Biology"
permalink: open-hardware-bio.html
---

This is a collection of websites that I am keeping track of in order to get an
overview of the current state of open hardware in biology.

I'll try to update this list regularly.

## OpenTrons

<https://opentrons.com/>

Open source/hardware robot. Plans, software and
script for protocols are tracked on github <https://github.com/OpenTrons>

## Gaudi lab

Open lab, an advanced list of resource is available on their website.
<http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/> plus many current projects <http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=19>
<http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/>

## Open hardware microfluidics

StreyLab - [Blog](http://streylab.com/blog/2015/4/8/open-hardware-microfluidics-controller-arduino-shield), [Github page](https://github.com/hstrey)

## Manu Prakash lab

Manu Prakash lab, home of impressive frugal science:

<https://profiles.stanford.edu/manu-prakash>

<http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab/cgi-bin/labsite/>

Tools they develop:

- [folding microscope](https://www.foldscope.com/)
- [punchcard microfuidic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4874)
- [citizen mosquito surveillance](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/25/120519)
- [paperfuge](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/30/072207)

Looks like the last two elements haven't gone through peer review yet.

## Bio Academany

<http://bio.academany.org/>

Distributed course on synthetic biology;
expensive, (at 5000$ / year ?), but provides hands on time through Fablabs (?).
The classes are hosted on Vimeo, and contain info on open hardware for biology.

## Hackteria
<http://www.hackteria.org/>

## Generics

- [Open Hardware Science](http://openhardware.science/)
- [Open Source hardware association](https://www.oshwa.org/)

## Others

- [Lego based liquid handling robot](https://youtu.be/f6yltxZg8Rw) :)
- [Open raman spectrometer](https://gitlab.com/ramanPi) on gitlab; more on the
chemistry side,
- Search `biology` on [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/) to get a constant feed of
new projects.


## Bonus ;)
<https://youtu.be/SGJ5cZnoodY> - Wired UK documentary on open
hardware development in the city of Shenzhen.
